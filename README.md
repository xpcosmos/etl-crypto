# Incomplete and Paused ETL Crypto Data Project

This project represents an ongoing initiative to create an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline for cryptocurrency data. However, it is important to note that this project is currently incomplete and has been temporarily paused for further development.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading of cryptocurrency-related data into a structured format for subsequent analysis. The planned ETL workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction from Cryptocurrency Sources**:
   - Utilizing various cryptocurrency APIs and data sources to retrieve real-time data, including prices, trading volumes, market capitalization, and historical price trends.
   - Implementing data retrieval strategies for multiple cryptocurrencies.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Processing the raw data obtained from the sources into a structured format.
   - Aggregating and cleaning the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   - Enriching the data with additional relevant information, such as cryptocurrency metadata and market sentiment.

3. **Data Loading**:
   - Storing the transformed data in a designated database or storage system for subsequent analysis and reporting.

4. **Scheduling and Monitoring**:
   - Leveraging automation tools, such as Apache Airflow, for scheduling regular data updates.
   - Implementing monitoring and logging features to track the ETL pipeline's execution and performance.

## Components Used

- **Cryptocurrency APIs**: Access to cryptocurrency data sources is essential for retrieving real-time information.
- **Python**: The primary scripting language used for data manipulation, automation, and workflow orchestration.
- **Database Systems**: Storage systems like SQL databases or NoSQL databases may be utilized for data storage.
- **JSON or CSV**: Common data formats used for handling and transforming raw data.

## Planned Workflow

1. The ETL process begins with the configuration of data sources, including selecting the cryptocurrencies of interest and defining the desired data fields.
2. API requests are made to cryptocurrency data sources to retrieve real-time data.
3. Raw data is transformed into a structured format, including data cleaning, aggregation, and enrichment.
4. The transformed data is loaded into a database or storage system, ensuring data integrity and security.
5. Scheduled ETL pipeline executions are set up to regularly update the cryptocurrency data.
6. Monitoring and logging mechanisms are implemented to track the pipeline's performance and detect any issues.

## Project Status

As of now, this project remains incomplete and is temporarily paused. Further development and refinement of the ETL pipeline are necessary to achieve the desired level of automation, accuracy, and functionality.

Incomplete aspects of the project include error handling, production-ready logging, and the implementation of advanced data analysis and visualization components.

The project's future progress and completion will depend on the allocation of resources, including time and expertise, to address the remaining tasks and challenges.
